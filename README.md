- 👋 Hi, I’m @john-sc
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, tennis, and life in general. I am a SQL, c++, c# person.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MS Azure development and devops. Going through the Tailspin examples. 
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate outside my work at present. I have plenty of collaboration there. Our current project is to integrate two systems using an Azure service bus with a message queue in each direction for the comms.
